# Student Management System

This is a simple command-line Student Management System implemented in Python. It allows users to perform basic operations such as adding, deleting, updating, and viewing student information. The code adheres to SOLID principles, eliminates redundancy, and follows best practices like KISS and YAGNI.

## Features

- Add New Student: Add a new student with a unique ID, name, age, and major.
- Delete Student: Remove a student from the database using their ID.
- Update Student Information: Update the name, age, or major of an existing student.
- View All Students: Display all students currently stored in the database.

## Refactoring and Improvements

- SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**: Each class now has a single responsibility. The `Student` class is responsible only for holding and displaying student data. The `StudentDatabase` manages student storage and operations, while the `StudentManagementSystem` handles the user interaction and higher-level management.
- OCP (Open/Closed Principle): The system is open for extension but closed for modification. You can easily extend functionalities like searching or filtering students by adding methods to the `StudentDatabase` without altering the core logic.
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Redundant code has been minimized. For instance, all student updates are now handled through a single method in the `StudentDatabase`.
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): The design is kept simple and easy to understand, with a clear separation of concerns.
- YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It): Removed unnecessary methods and complexity, focusing only on required features.
